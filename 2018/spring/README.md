======================== README ====================

These scripts are realized to demonstrate the capabilites of 
machine learning (ml) for the italian event winston smith spring
edition 2018. 

So to use these scripts you have to to make an account with 
Google https://cloud.google.com/products/machine-learning/. 

You have to save the key in a file named 'visione.json'

At this point you have to search, choose and download some jpg files, 
with faces. These faces MUST be in a "frontal view". 

At this point DoAll.sh will make near to all the work ... 

Let me know if you have trouble and I'll try to help you


License WTF, MIT or whatever you want.
