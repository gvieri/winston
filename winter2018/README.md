### winston aka repository of demo files for winston-smith events

see e-privacy.winstonsmith.org. 

This code is really simple. It uses google cloud vision to search for faces in the jpg files that are stored in the directory .

The program will open these files one at time and, show it, send the right request to google api and it will show the results. 

So you will need an account and you must be prepared to pay if necessary. 

You have to insert the account data in a file called visione.json 
This file has now inserted with dummy contents. 

Happy emotion hacking!
